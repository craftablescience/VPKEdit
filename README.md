## Planned Features

See [the open issues on this repository marked as an enhancement](https://github.com/craftablescience/VPKEdit/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aenhancement).

## Backend

This tool is powered by an open-source pack file editing library, libvpkedit. This library's code is stored in this same repository,
written in C++20 and also under the MIT license. Its code was initially based off of [ValvePak](https://github.com/SteamDatabase/ValvePak)
and the Valve Developer Wiki (see [the credits](https://github.com/craftablescience/VPKEdit/blob/main/CREDITS.md) for more information).
